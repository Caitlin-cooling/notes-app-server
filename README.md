#Notes App
This is an updated version of my notes app that takes user inout from the command line and uses a server.

## How to Use
Start your server by running the ruby file `test_server_ex.rb` from the command line. Note that this will continue to be accessible until it is closed.

User the command `telnet localhost 2345` to access the program.

You will be asked if you want to create new, view notes or quit.

If you choose to create you will be asked for a title and a body. If you choose the view you will see a list of the titles of the notes that are currently stored. Quit will exit the program.
